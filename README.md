# PathwayViewer

The html is fairly basic and has a script at the bottom that creates a KeggPathway object.  
When loading the html from the web browser it requires a kegg pathway id in the url query.
Example:
```
<url>/pathway.html?id=hsa04512
```
To make the code work for you there are a few things that would need to be changed.  
<!--On [line 1012](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L1012-L1055) this is where the raw data is downloaded from. -->The changes needed are in [kegg-pathway2.js](js/kegg-pathway2.js). The [DownloadFile function on Line 36](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L36-L44) would need to be changed to download from your rest api. 
Each of the following lines of code use the downloadFile function to get a file that is required to display the map properly:
* [Line 1015](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L1015) for matrix.csv
* [Line 964](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L964) for dendro_row.json
* [Line 969](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L969) for background.csv
* [Line 1186](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L1186) for metadata.tsv

####matrix.csv
This is a matrix of protein expression values with sample ids in the first row and gene ids in the first column. We use this to color our heat map on a gradient scale from red to blue.

####metadata.tsv
This file is a tab dilimited table with meta information about samples with sample ids in the first column and meta info ids in the first row.

####dendro_row.json
This file is a hierarchical structure of the genes in a json format. This is used for a dendrogram in the heat map view and here to find the groups of proteins.

####background.csv
This file is a conversion table to map the ids on the matrix to the ids in the kegg pathway.
