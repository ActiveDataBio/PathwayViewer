# PathwayViewer
This repository represents the skeleton of what is used by us in the Active Data Biology pathway views ([website] (https://adbio.pnnl.gov) or [tutorial video] (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LU280SWWFUc)). ADBio has a fairly complex set of interactions beyond simply drawing a KEGG map, and our javascript is therefore a bit more complicated than you might expect.

There are four basic parts of this webpage: html, javascript, webservice, and associated files. The html page sets the basic framework. The javascript is code meant to help identify which protiens on the page should be highlighted and where those colored pixels go to overlay the KEGG map. The webservice is how the javascript communicates to the KEGG database. And associated files are explained below.

The html is fairly basic and has a script at the bottom that creates a KeggPathway object.  
When loading the html from the web browser, the URL query requires a kegg pathway id and cluster id.
Example:
```
<url>/pathway.html?id=hsa04512&node=node1662
```
The node is the id for the cluster of protiens, something specific to our application. You can probably delete this.

###javascript
The overall purpose of this is to generate an svg on top of the static image from KEGG. Using the Pathway ID passed in through the URL, we look up the proteins that need to be colored. For us, we draw only specific proteins in the heatmap. That's why you see a reference to the matrix.csv (our heatmap) and the dendro_row.json (the descirptor for which proteins go in which nodes/clusters of the heatmap.
To make the code work for you there are a few things that would need to be changed in [kegg-pathway2.js](js/kegg-pathway2.js). The [DownloadFile function on Line 36](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L36-L44) would need to be changed to download from your rest api. 
Each of the following lines of code use the downloadFile function to retreive the required files and display the map properly:
* [Line 1015](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L1015) for matrix.csv
* [Line 964](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L964) for dendro_row.json
* [Line 969](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L969) for background.csv
* [Line 1186](js/kegg-pathway2.js#L1186) for metadata.tsv

The javascript interacts with a database to request a KGML file (which we create on the fly because it saves db space) which describes the image of a pathway. That means that the KGML says where the box for each gene is on the image. That's the information we use to create our SVG colored overlay.

####matrix.csv
This is a matrix of protein expression values with sample ids in the first row and gene ids in the first column. We use this to color our heat map on a gradient scale from red to blue. we also use this information for the pop-up high-charts that show the average expression by sub-type. If you are only using one color to overlay the kegg image, then you probably don't need this information.

####metadata.tsv
This file is a tab delimited table with meta information about samples with sample ids in the first column and meta info ids in the first row. This is used to describe which samples belong a particular subtype (used in the chooser up top) or the pop-up.

####dendro_row.json
This file is a hierarchical structure of the genes in a json format. This is used for a dendrogram in the heat map view and here to find which protein belong to the specified node (and thus which should be drawn).

####background.csv
This file is a conversion table to map the ids on the matrix to the ids in the kegg pathway. Specifically this contains the gene name, which is what the KGML uses instead of accessions.
